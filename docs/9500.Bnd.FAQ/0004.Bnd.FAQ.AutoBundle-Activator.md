# Why No Automatic Bundle-Activator

Many people are surprised that bnd does not automatically calculate the Bundle-Activator. Basically, there are the following issues: 



*   Not all bundles have a bundle activator 
*   Detecting an activator in the code does not always mean you want one 
*   Detecting means you can find more than one 

That said, it is possible to automate the Bundle-Activator: 



    Bundle-Activator:    \${classes;IMPLEMENTS;org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator}
    

However, if there are multiple Bundle-Activators you will get an error.
