# Remove unwanted imports

If you have an unwanted import than you can remove it from the Import-Package manifest header with the '!' operator: 



    Import-Package: !com.unwanted.reference.*, *
    

A usually better way is to make the imports optional: 



    Import-Package: com.unwanted.reference.*;optional:=true, *
    

Note the end at the Import-Package statement, that wildcard '*' is crucial for remaining imports, see [No Imports Show Up][16]. 


 [16]: #noImports
