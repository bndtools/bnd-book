# Why are superclass not inspected for Component annotations?

Annotations are not inherited form the component's super classes. The problem is that bnd cannot in all cases can see super classes (and interfaces) because the super class does not have to be available in the build. In runtime you are sure the super class is there, at build time you do not have that luxury. So to make sure, always define your annotations on the actual component class.
