# Too Many Imports

Sometimes bnd reports imports that seem plain wrong. Believe me, they are almost always right. bnd does a thorough analysis of the byte codes in your class files and when it imports something it is almost sure to be a reference in your code. How can you find the culprit? [Bndtools][14][?][14] has tooling to drill down into your code. bnd also can print out the JAR and look at the `[USEDBY]` section to find the package(s) that cause the import. 

If there is no package using the imported package, then look at the following places for imports: 

*   Spring/Blueprint XML 
*   Bundle Activator 
*   Component annotations or Service-Component headers 

In the likely case the import is real but unwanted, look at [Unwanted Imports][15].
