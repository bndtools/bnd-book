# What should I use instead of the Bundle-ClassPath?

Just use `Private-Package` and `Export-Package`, know what goes into your JAR. 

If you really need to wrap one or more JARs, use the `Include-Resource` instruction, it has an option to unroll a JAR resource (see option). 

This will copy all its contents in the target JAR. The `-exportcontents` can then be used to export selected packages.
