# Can't find the source of the version on an Export-Package?

If no explicit export version is specified in the bnd file then bnd will look in the following places. 



1.  packageinfo file in the package directory (recommended) 
2.  package-info.java, bnd's Version annotation 
3.  Manifest of the exporting JAR 

There was a mis-feature in an [older version of the maven plugin][19] that appended the pom version to the exported packages. It looked professional but it was baloney. Versioning a bundle should not version a package automatically, try it and feel the pain. So if you can't find the source of an exported package version you might have an old maven bundle plugin.
