## packageinfo or package-info.java?

Inspired by the osgi-dev thread [Why default version for Export-Package is 0.0.0, not bundle version?][17] I'm just a little bit confused about the bnd approach with the file naming "packageinfo". The [JLS][18] already defines "package-info.java" for package relevant infos. Wouldn't it be simplier (less complex) to have only one file for package definitions? So, the bnd tool could manage the package version in "package-info.java", too. 

You can use either file. The reason there are two options is that one constituency thinks annotations are the only solution and the other is running pre Java 5 ... Basically if I would have to choose it would be packageinfo because that works anywhere but I expect that you probably would not like that :-)
